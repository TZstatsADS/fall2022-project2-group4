![screenshot](doc/figs/map.jpg)

In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop an *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on motor vehicle crash data collected by the **NYPD** released on [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95). In particular, our project aims to analyze the effect of COVID-19 on the rate of traffic accidents and on the rate of severe accidents in NYC.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server
